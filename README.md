Developed a robust Vehicle Sales Management System in Java, utilizing advanced object-oriented design principles for accurate vehicle pricing and dynamic discounts.

Key Achievements:

Crafted an effective class hierarchy with a superclass (Vehicle) and subclasses (Car and Motorcycle) to represent diverse vehicle types.
Implemented encapsulation to safeguard attributes (Vehicle Type, Manufacturer, Base Price) using appropriate getter methods.
Demonstrated proficiency in object instantiation by employing constructors for seamless attribute initialization.
Introduced specialized methods (calculateTax and calculateTotalPrice) for precise tax and total price calculations.
Implemented method overloading, introducing a dynamic calculateTotalPrice method accommodating discount percentages for flexible pricing.
Showcased method overriding in subclasses (Car and Motorcycle) to tailor tax and total price calculations based on vehicle type.

Technologies Used:
Java, IntelliJ IDEA

Sample Output:
For a variety of vehicles (SUV, Car, Motorcycle) with unique attributes, the system accurately computes total prices and applies discounts, presenting a versatile pricing solution.Developed a robust Vehicle Sales Management System in Java, utilizing advanced object-oriented design principles for accurate vehicle pricing and dynamic discounts.
